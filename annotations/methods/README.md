# Method annotations

## `tags`

### Purpose

> This annotation is an equivalent of the `tags` property of the OpenAPI OAS 3.0 Specification. Note
  that it works slighly differently than its OAS counterpart. It has been simplified and tags are
  defined and accessed globally whether at the root of the document or on a method.
